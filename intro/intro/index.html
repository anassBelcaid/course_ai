Rational agents exist in an <strong>environment</strong>, which is specific to the given instantiation of the agent. Agents use sensors to interact with the environment and act on it using actuators. As a very simple example, the environment for a checkers agent is the virtual checkers board on which it plays against opponents, where piece moves are actions. Together, an environment and the agents that reside within it create a <strong>world</strong>.</p> <p>A <strong>reflex agent</strong> is one that doesn’t think about the consequences of its actions but selects an action based solely on the current state of the world. These agents are typically outperformed by <strong>planning agents</strong>, which maintain a model of the world and use this model to simulate performing various actions. Then, the agent can determine hypothesized consequences of the actions and select the best one. This is simulated “intelligence” in the sense that it’s exactly what humans do when trying to determine the best possible move in any situation - thinking ahead.</p> <p>The <strong>design</strong> of an agent heavily depends on the type of environment the agent acts upon. We can characterize the types of environments in the following ways:</p> <ul> <li>In partially observable environments, the agent does not have full information about the state and thus must have an internal estimate of the state of the world. This is in contrast to fully observable environments, where the agent has full information about their state.</li> <li>Stochastic environments have uncertainty in the transition model, i.e., taking an action in a specific state may have multiple possible outcomes with different probabilities. This is in contrast to deterministic environments, where taking an action in a state has a single outcome that is guaranteed to happen.</li> <li>In multi-agent environments, the agent acts along with other agents. For this reason, the agent might need to randomize its actions to avoid being “predictable” by other agents.</li> <li>If the environment does not change as the agent acts on it, it is called static. This is in contrast to dynamic environments that change as the agent interacts with them.</li> <li>If an environment has known physics, then the transition model (even if stochastic) is known to the agent, and it can use that when planning a path. If the physics are unknown, the agent will need to take actions deliberately to learn the unknown dynamics.</li> </ul> <h2 id="state-spaces">State Spaces</h2> <p>In order to create a rational planning agent, we need a way to mathematically express the given environment in which the agent will exist. To do this, we must formally express a <strong>search problem</strong> - given our agent’s current <strong>state</strong> (its configuration within its environment), how can we arrive at a new state that satisfies its goals in the best possible way? A search problem consists of the following elements:</p> <ul> <li>A <strong>state space</strong> - The set of all possible states that are possible in your given world</li> <li>A set of <strong>actions</strong> available in each state</li> <li>A <strong>transition model</strong> - Outputs the next state when a specific action is taken at current state</li> <li>An action <strong>cost</strong> - Incurred when moving from one state to another after applying an action</li> <li>A <strong>start state</strong> - The state in which an agent exists initially</li> <li>A <strong>goal test</strong> - A function that takes a state as input, and determines whether it is a goal state</li> </ul> <blockquote> <p>Fundamentally, a search problem is solved by first considering the start state, then exploring the state space using the action and transition and cost methods, iteratively computing children of various states until we arrive at a goal state, at which point we will have determined a path from the start state to the goal state (typically called a <strong>plan</strong>). The order in which states are considered is determined using a predetermined <strong>strategy</strong>. We’ll cover types of strategies and their usefulness shortly.</p> </blockquote> <p>Before we continue with how to solve search problems, it’s important to note the difference between a <strong>world state</strong>, and a <strong>search state</strong>. A world state contains all information about a given state, whereas a search state contains only the information about the world that’s necessary for planning (primarily for space efficiency reasons). To illustrate these concepts, we’ll introduce the hallmark motivating example of this course - Pacman. The game of Pacman is simple: Pacman must navigate a maze and eat all the (small) food pellets in the maze without being eaten by the malicious patrolling ghosts. If Pacman eats one of the (large) power pellets, he becomes ghost-immune for a set period of time and gains the ability to eat ghosts for points.</p> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/course_ai/intro/pacman_example-480.webp 480w,/course_ai/intro/pacman_example-800.webp 800w,/course_ai/intro/pacman_example-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/course_ai/intro/pacman_example.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="caption"> Example of concrete pacman state representation. Try to think of the essential information that are needed in order to represent the game. </div> <p>Let’s consider a variation of the game in which the maze contains only Pacman and food pellets. We can pose two distinct search problems in this scenario: pathing and eat-all-dots. Pathing attempts to solve the problem of getting from position $(x_2, y_1)$ to position $(x_2, y_2)$ in the maze optimally, while eat all dots attempts to solve the problem of consuming all food pellets in the maze in the shortest time possible. Below, the states, actions, transition model, and goal test for both problems are listed:</p> <h4 id="pathing">Pathing</h4> <ul> <li>States: $(x,y)$</li> <li>Actions: North, South, East, West</li> <li>Transition model (getting the next state): Update location only</li> <li>Goal test: Is $(x,y) = \textbf{END}$</li> </ul> <h4 id="eating-all-the-dots">Eating all the dots</h4> <ul> <li>States: $\left[(x,y), \text{dot boolean}\right]$</li> <li>Actions: North, South, East, West</li> <li>Transition model (getting the next state): Update location and booleans</li> <li>Goal test: Are all dot booleans false?</li> </ul> <p>Note that for pathing, states contain less information than states for eat-all-dots, because for eat-all-dots we must maintain an array of booleans corresponding to each food pellet and whether or not it’s been eaten in the given state. A world state may contain more information still, potentially encoding information about things like total distance traveled by Pacman or all positions visited by Pacman on top of its current $(x,y)$ location and dot booleans.</p> <h3 id="state-space-size">State Space Size</h3> <p>An important question that often comes up while estimating the computational runtime of solving a search problem is the size of the state space. This is done almost exclusively with the <strong>fundamental counting principle</strong>, which states that if there are n variable objects in a given world which can take on $(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)$ different values respectively, then the total number of states is $x_1 x_2 \ldots x_n$</p> <p>Let’s use Pacman to show this concept by example</p> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/course_ai/intro/state_space_size-480.webp 480w,/course_ai/intro/state_space_size-800.webp 800w,/course_ai/intro/state_space_size-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/course_ai/intro/state_space_size.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="caption"> Example of concrete pacman state representation. Try to think of the essential information that are needed in order to represent the game. </div> <p>Let’s say that the variable objects and their corresponding number of possibilities are as follows:</p> <ul> <li>Pacman positions - Pacman can be in 120 distinct $(x,y)$ positions, and there is only one Pacman.</li> <li>Pacman Direction - this can be North, South, East, or West, for a total of 4 possibilities.</li> <li>Ghost positions - There are two ghosts, each of which can be in 12 distinct $(x,y)$ positions.</li> <li>Food pellet configurations - There are 30 food pellets, each of which can be eaten or not eaten</li> </ul> <p>Using the fundamental counting principle, we have 120 positions for Pacman, 4 directions Pacman can be facing, $12\dot12$ ghost configurations (12 for each ghost), and $2 2 \ldots 2 = 2^30$. food pellet configurations (each of 30 food pellets has two possible values - eaten or not eaten). This gives us a total state space size of</p> \[120 \times 4 \times 12^2 \times 2^30\] <h3 id="state-space-graphs-and-search-trees">State Space Graphs and Search Trees</h3> <p>Now that we’ve established the idea of a state space and the four components necessary to completely define one, we’re almost ready to begin solving search problems. The final piece of the puzzle is that of state space graphs and search trees.</p> <p>Recall that a graph is defined by a set of nodes and a set of edges connecting various pairs of nodes. These edges may also have weights associated with them. A <strong>state space graph</strong> is constructed with states representing nodes, with directed edges existing from a state to its children. These edges represent actions, and any associated weights represent the cost of performing the corresponding action. Typically, state space graphs are much too large to store in memory (even our simple Pacman example from above has $\approx 10^13$ possible states, yikes!), but they’re good to keep in mind conceptually while solving problems. It’s also important to note that in a state space graph, each state is represented exactly once - there’s simply no need to represent a state multiple times, and knowing this helps quite a bit when trying to reason about search problems.</p> <p>Unlike state space graphs, our next structure of interest, <strong>search trees</strong>, have no such restriction on the number of times a state can appear. This is because though search trees are also a class of graph with states as nodes and actions as edges between states, each state/node encodes not just the state itself, but the entire path (or plan) from the start state to the given state in the state space graph. Observe the state space graph and corresponding search tree below:</p> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/course_ai/intro/graph_and_tree-480.webp 480w,/course_ai/intro/graph_and_tree-800.webp 800w,/course_ai/intro/graph_and_tree-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/course_ai/intro/graph_and_tree.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="caption"> The highlighted path (S → d → e → r → f → G) in the given state space graph is represented in the corresponding search tree by following the path in the tree from the start state S to the highlighted goal state G. Similarly, each and every path from the start node to any other node is represented in the search tree by a path from the root S to some descendant of the root corresponding to the other node. Since there often exist multiple ways to get from one state to another, states tend to show up multiple times in search trees. As a result, search trees are greater than or equal to their corresponding state space graph in size. We’ve already determined that state space graphs themselves can be enormous in size even for simple problems, and so the question arises - how can we perform useful computation on these structures if they’re too big to represent in memory? The answer lies in how we compute the children of a current state - we only store states we’re immediately working with, and compute new ones on-demand using the corresponding getNextState, getAction, and getActionCost methods. Typically, search problems are solved using search trees, where we very carefully store a select few nodes to observe at a time, iteratively replacing nodes with their children until we arrive at a goal state. There exist various methods by which to decide the order in which to conduct this iterative replacement of search tree nodes, and we’ll present these methods now. </div> </d-article> <d-appendix> <d-footnote-list></d-footnote-list> <d-citation-list></d-citation-list> </d-appendix> <d-bibliography src="/course_ai/assets/bibliography/2018-12-22-distill.bib"></d-bibliography> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2025 Anass Dr. Belcaid. </div> </footer> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3.6.0/dist/jquery.min.js" integrity="sha256-/xUj+3OJU5yExlq6GSYGSHk7tPXikynS7ogEvDej/m4=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="/course_ai/assets/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mdbootstrap@4.20.0/js/mdb.min.js" integrity="sha256-NdbiivsvWt7VYCt6hYNT3h/th9vSTL4EDWeGs5SN3DA=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js@4.4.1/dist/chart.umd.min.js" integrity="sha256-0q+JdOlScWOHcunpUk21uab1jW7C1deBQARHtKMcaB4=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/course_ai/assets/js/chartjs-setup.js?183c5859923724fb1cb3c67593848e71" type="text/javascript"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/echarts@5.5.0/dist/echarts.min.js" integrity="sha256-QvgynZibb2U53SsVu98NggJXYqwRL7tg3FeyfXvPOUY=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/echarts@5.5.0/theme/dark-fresh-cut.js" integrity="sha256-sm6Ui9w41++ZCWmIWDLC18a6ki72FQpWDiYTDxEPXwU=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/course_ai/assets/js/echarts-setup.js?738178999630746a8d0cfc261fc47c2c" type="text/javascript"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega@5.27.0/build/vega.min.js" integrity="sha256-Yot/cfgMMMpFwkp/5azR20Tfkt24PFqQ6IQS+80HIZs=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega-lite@5.16.3/build/vega-lite.min.js" integrity="sha256-TvBvIS5jUN4BSy009usRjNzjI1qRrHPYv7xVLJyjUyw=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega-embed@6.24.0/build/vega-embed.min.js" integrity="sha256-FPCJ9JYCC9AZSpvC/t/wHBX7ybueZhIqOMjpWqfl3DU=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/course_ai/assets/js/vega-setup.js?7c7bee055efe9312afc861b128fe5f36" type="text/javascript"></script> <script defer src="https://tikzjax.com/v1/tikzjax.js" integrity="sha256-+1qyucCXRZJrCg3lm3KxRt/7WXaYhBid4/1XJRHGB1E=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="/course_ai/assets/js/typograms.js?062e75bede72543443762dc3fe36c7a5"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/medium-zoom@1.1.0/dist/medium-zoom.min.js" integrity="sha256-ZgMyDAIYDYGxbcpJcfUnYwNevG/xi9OHKaR/8GK+jWc=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/course_ai/assets/js/zoom.js?85ddb88934d28b74e78031fd54cf8308"></script> <script src="/course_ai/assets/js/no_defer.js?2781658a0a2b13ed609542042a859126"></script> <script defer src="/course_ai/assets/js/common.js?e0514a05c5c95ac1a93a8dfd5249b92e"></script> <script defer src="/course_ai/assets/js/copy_code.js?12775fdf7f95e901d7119054556e495f" type="text/javascript"></script> <script defer src="/course_ai/assets/js/jupyter_new_tab.js?d9f17b6adc2311cbabd747f4538bb15f"></script> <script defer type="text/javascript" id="MathJax-script" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3.2.2/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js" integrity="sha256-MASABpB4tYktI2Oitl4t+78w/lyA+D7b/s9GEP0JOGI=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="/course_ai/assets/js/mathjax-setup.js?a5bb4e6a542c546dd929b24b8b236dfd"></script> <script defer src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/polyfill/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/course_ai/assets/js/progress-bar.js?2f30e0e6801ea8f5036fa66e1ab0a71a" type="text/javascript"></script> <script src="/course_ai/assets/js/vanilla-back-to-top.min.js?f40d453793ff4f64e238e420181a1d17"></script> <script>

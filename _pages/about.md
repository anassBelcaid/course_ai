This course provides a comprehensive introduction to Artificial Intelligence, covering fundamental techniques that enable intelligent decision-making. Students will explore classical search algorithms, adversarial search in competitive environments, constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) for solving complex puzzles, and Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) for sequential decision-making. The course also delves into reinforcement learning, where agents learn optimal behaviors through interaction, and Bayesian networks, which offer a probabilistic framework for reasoning under uncertainty. Through theoretical foundations and practical applications, students will develop a solid understanding of AI's core principles and problem-solving strategies.

## Course Goals

Upon completion of the course, students should be able to:  

- Implement and experiment with fundamental AI algorithms, including search, adversarial search, constraint satisfaction, Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), reinforcement learning, and Bayesian networks.  
- Analyze and compare the efficiency, completeness, and optimality of different AI techniques.  
- Apply AI methods to solve real-world problems requiring planning, decision-making, and uncertainty handling.  
- Understand and critically evaluate research papers in artificial intelligence.  
- Extend existing AI algorithms by exploring new heuristics, learning strategies, or probabilistic models.


## Prerequisite Knowledge:

Students should have a solid understanding of the following areas:  

- **Algorithms**: e.g., How do uninformed and informed search algorithms work? What is the minimax algorithm used for?
